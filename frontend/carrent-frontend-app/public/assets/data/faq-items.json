      "answer": "To rent a car, you will need a valid driver's license, a credit card in your name, and a government-issued photo ID (such as a passport or national ID).

      "question": "Is there an age requirement to rent a car?",

      "question": "Can I add an additional driver to my rental?",
      "answer": "Yes, you can add additional drivers to your rental. Each additional driver must meet the same age and license requirements as the primary driver and must be present at the rental counter to show their license. There may be an additional fee for extra drivers, though this fee is sometimes waived for spouses or domestic partners."

      "question": "What should I do if the rental car breaks down or I get into an accident?",
      "answer": "If the rental car breaks down or you're involved in an accident, first ensure everyone's safety and call emergency services if needed. Then contact our 24/7 roadside assistance number provided in your rental agreement. Document the incident with photos and collect information from other parties involved if applicable. Do not admit fault or liability. We'll arrange for a replacement vehicle as quickly as possible."

      "question": "Is there a mileage limit on my rental?",
      "answer": "Most of our standard rentals come with unlimited mileage. However, certain specialty vehicles, long-term rentals, or promotional rates may have daily or total mileage restrictions. Any mileage limitations will be clearly stated in your rental agreement before you sign. Exceeding the mileage limit will result in additional charges per extra mile driven."

Some locations may accept debit cards with certain restrictions. Cash, prepaid cards, and gift cards are generally not accepted. A hold or deposit will be placed on your card at the time of rental."

      "question": "Can I pick up the car in one location and return it to another?",
      "answer": "Yes, one-way rentals are available at many of our locations. However, a one-way fee may apply, which varies based on the distance between locations. International one-way rentals may have additional restrictions or may not be available between certain countries due to border regulations."

      "question": "What is your fuel policy?",
      "answer": "Our standard policy is 'full-to-full,' meaning you'll receive the car with a full tank and are expected to return it with a full tank. If you return the car with less fuel than at pickup, you'll be charged for the missing fuel plus a refueling service fee. We also offer a prepaid fuel option where you can purchase a full tank at the beginning of your rental."
